# pytorch-deaf
This is PyTorch implementation of "Deep Edge-Aware Filters"

# Motivation to the project

- Implementation is based on Matlab, so I like to write it in pytorch/
*pytorch_lightning* and open-source it.
- It shows how to use deep learning for learning filters
- Streamlit app
- integrate with GIMP
- I want to put it in snap ml and see how it works
